**PROJECT TITLE: Google Search Analysis**
**Purpose**
This repository contains an analysis of Google search trends using Python. By leveraging search query data, we can gain insights into user behavior, interests, and global search trends, which is invaluable for market research, SEO, and content strategy.

**Motivation**
With billions of searches conducted on Google daily, it remains the most visited website globally. As of 2024, Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day (Internet Live Stats, 2024), which translates to more than 99,000 search queries per second. This enormous volume of data presents an excellent opportunity to analyze trends, keywords, and patterns in user behavior, making Google search data a valuable resource for businesses and researchers alike.

Googleâ€™s dominance as the world's largest search engine makes it a key use case for data analysis based on search trends, helping us understand shifts in demand, consumer interests, and real-time events.
